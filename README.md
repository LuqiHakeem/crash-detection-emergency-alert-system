# 🏍 Crash Detection & Emergency Alert System for Riders

## 📌 Academic Background

This project was developed as a Mini Project for the Embedded Systems course during my engineering studies at Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP).

The objective of this project was to apply embedded system concepts learned in class into a real-world safety application. The system integrates sensor data processing, microcontroller programming, and wireless communication to create an automated crash detection and emergency alert mechanism for motorcycle riders.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The system is built using Raspberry Pi Pico W and MPU6050 accelerometer sensor. It continuously monitors acceleration data and detects abnormal impact forces that may indicate a crash event.

Once the crash threshold is exceeded:
- An emergency alert is sent via Telegram Bot
- A buzzer is activated
- The system continues monitoring in real time

This project demonstrates the practical application of embedded programming, sensor interfacing, and IoT communication within an academic environment.
